# Firing Order

Determine valid engine firing orders for piston engines

---

Perl script and Excel workbook that simulates various engine crank/piston configurations to report out valid firing orders.

Inputs:
- Number of pistons
- Crank angle for top-dead center (TDC) of each piston

## Future Work

This thing is crying for some kind of graphical representation of the crank and each piston.
